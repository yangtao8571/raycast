what ray-cast algorithm can do?


    After read the article "A first-person engine in 265 lines" at http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/,
I was intrested in how that worked. Then I post this repository to record what I've got.
    These codes are simple and stupid, implement a first person shoot style game, enjoy!
